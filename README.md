# Virtual Assistant for farmers

I developed a Virtual Assistant for Farmers integrated with a Telegram Bot, powered by a GPT-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to provide real-time agricultural support. This assistant allows farmers to ask queries related to crop care, pest control, fertilizers, weather, and government schemes through the Telegram app, receiving accurate and conversational responses generated by the GPT model. The system is built using Python, Telegram Bot API, and integrates OpenAI’s GPT model to process and understand natural language queries effectively. This solution makes farming advice more accessible, promotes digital literacy in rural areas, and reduces farmers’ dependence on intermediaries for information, offering a smart, AI-driven platform for instant agricultural guidance.
